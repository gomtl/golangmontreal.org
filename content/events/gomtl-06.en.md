This Golang Montreal meetup is dedicated to [EOS](https://eos.io).

EOS is a 3rd generation blockchain launching 1-2 June 2018.

During the month of May, the EOS community organizes a worldwide hackathon
called [Hack Til Dawn](https://hack-til-dawn.com/).

As a candidate for Block Producer and leader in blockchain tech, EOS Canada
developed an extensive Go library that manages interactions with all aspects of
the EOS blockchain.

Signal to noise in the blockchain space is, as you know, very low. It should be
refreshing to have something concrete to chew on!

This event is sponsored by EOS Canada, folks from the Montreal community.
