### Activities

Golang Montréal is a group of users of the Go programming language.

Our goal is to build a strong local community by putting together programmers,
project leaders, artists and service providers.

Our main events are the _Golang Montréal meetups_, some mini-conferences that
occur every 4 to 6 weeks.  They take place during week-day evenings, and usually
last about 2 hours.  Featured, are, 5 to 45 minutes talks that cover a broad
range of subjects and cater to people of all skill set levels: newcomers as well as experts.

### Attendees

We attract Go enthusiasts, beginners & specialists, alike.  We expect to have 30-50
attendees at our meetups.  The startup community is considering Go, more and more, when building new companies.  Several established company CTOs are also known to have come around.

### Why sponsor

Sponsorships help us keep the events free of charge, essential for our success.

By sponsoring Golang Montréal, you will:

* Foster the growth of a healthy local community;

* Make yourself known to top programmers, lead developers and very smart people
  who might be interested in working for you — now or later;

* Gain visibility for both recruiting and promotion of your product and
  services: banners, quick introduction, etc.;

* Increase your profile in this very smart community of field leaders.
